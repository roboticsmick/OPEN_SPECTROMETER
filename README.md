# OPEN_SPECTROMETER

This library allows you to use the Ocean Optics ST-VIS range of spectrometers using a Raspberry Pi Zerro 2W and a LCD display to view spectra using the Seabreeze API. This allows for a very small low power package that can easily be integrated into a small handheld device for field work. 

Lots of love to the the people working on keeping the PySeabreeze API alive. This let me get the Ocena Optic Spectrometer working on an ARM device. 

## Installing Pyseabreeze on PC

```sh
cd
mkdir pysb
cd pysb
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install seabreeze[pyseabreeze]
seabreeze_os_setup
```

## 2.4inch RPi Display For RPi

Flash the pi with Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit)

```sh
sudo apt install rpi-imager
```

Setup parameters:
1. Raspberry Pi Device: Raspberry Pi Zeroe 2 W
2. Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04 Server LTS (https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-your-raspberry-pi#1-overview)
3. Stoage - Use a Samsung 128GB PRO Plus microSD Card or high quality SD card. Get the best one you can afford from a reputable supplier. Don't be cheap here.
4. Select $Edit Settings$
  1. Set hostname: $rpi$
  2.Tick $Set username and password$
  3. Set username: $pi$
  4. Set password: $spectro$
  5. Tick $Configure wireless LAN$
  6. Enter known wifi name (I use my mobile hotspot name so I can access this easily in the field)
  7. Enter wifi password I use my mobile hotspot password so I can access this easily in the field)
  8. Set Wireless LAN country: $AU$
  9. Tick $Set locale settings$
  10. Timezone: $Australia/Brisbane$
  11. Keyboard Layout: $US$
  12. Select Services Tab
  13. Tick $Enable SSH - Use password authentication$
  14. Click Save
  15. Click Yes to apply OS customisation settings when you write the image to the storage device.

This will flash the OS to the SD card.

Enable your mobile phone hotspot so it can connect to the wifi.
Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi. 
Boot up the Raspberry Pi.
*Note: When first booting *
Check you mobile phone hotspot. 
When a connection is detected, you Raspberry Pi will have internet access. Check you mobile phone hotspot connections. The Raspberry Pi should show. Click on this and you should be able to see the IP address.
Connect you laptops wifi to your mobile phone hotspot. 
From a terminal on you PC SSH into the Raspberry Pi.

```sh
ping rpi.local
# Copy IP address from ping below into <IP>
ssh -X pi@<IP>
```
Enter password: spectro

### Setting up the Raspberry Pi software for the LCD


```sh
cd
nano setup_pi.sh
```

Copy the code into the text file editor.

```bash

```

```sh
chmod +x setup_pi.sh
./setup_pi.sh
```
